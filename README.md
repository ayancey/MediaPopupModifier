*before and after*

At some point, Spotify started using some API to pop up media controls along with the volume when you move the volume slider on your keyboard/mouse/header/whatever. It's really big, and kind of annoying, especially if you're playing a video game.

**MediaPopupModifier**. Version 1.0 hides the media controls by setting the width of the window using low level Windows APIs.



# Download/How to Use
[Click here](https://github.com/ayancey/MediaPopupModifier/releases) and download the newest release. Simply double click to launch, and it will run silently in the background. If you use it continually, add it to your startup folder.

# TODO
* A nice GUI with options for minimize to tray
* Change popup duration
* Option for removing the entire popup
